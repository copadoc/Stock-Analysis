# Stock-Analysis
Module
Stock-Analysis
Overview of Project
When looking at the overall goal for the stock-analysis project, one of the first conclusions this analysis provides was the negative performance of “DQ Energy” investment. In addition, the Stock-Analysis for part two of the module provided some valuable information when in came to showing the total output for specific stocks for both 2017 and 2018. After researching further, the full analysis lets us compare performance stock by year and by stock name and more importantly, the project allows to time the performance of the code created in VBA. 
As first demonstrated in the first first stock analysis titled “DQ”, the VBA script found that stock for “DQ Energy” was down to a significant amount to 6.3% and thus was a bad investment. Additionally, further VBA coding allowed to find results for other stocks as well.<img width="517" alt="Screenshot 2022-04-06 125314" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99380969/162635419-25c0b54f-6b71-496c-92e2-659e812d7141.png">


The second example of the outcomes found with VBA stock analysis was the output of stocks between the years 2017 and 2018. During the year of 2017, for example, the stock analysis demonstrated that all but one of the stocks performed well, as demonstrated by the chart below. <img width="605" alt="VBA_Challenge_2017 png " src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99380969/162635460-e9863715-19e0-4ce6-9e46-a23d35420e17.png">

In juxtaposition, the 2018 stock analysis painted a completely different picture in that all but two of the stocks presented were performing well.

To summarize, for me, refactoring the code at first, it threw some of the other code out of order for some reason. At times, the code that I had written prior to the refactoring of the code would not run properly also. However, after figuring out what was incorrect, the refactored code was able to demonstrate many pros and cons. As an example, once the refractured code was implemented correctly, it provided analysis for both 2017 and 2018 and it allows for comparison as to how much those stocks changed from those years.
